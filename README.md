# Stock-Price-Forecasting-with-Machine-Learning

This repository contains Python code for stock price prediction using LSTM. I aim to forecast the closing price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock leveraging historical stock data.

## Dataset <a name="dataset"></a>

The dataset used in this project, named 'AAPL_short_volume.csv', is extracted from OpenBB, a prominent open-source investment analysis company. The dataset consists of historical closing prices of AAPL stock, which will be used for training and evaluating our machine-learning model. The 'AAPL_short_volume.csv' file can be found in the "data" directory of this repository.

## Model Evaluation and Results <a name="model-evaluation-and-results"></a>

To evaluate the performance of the model, I use the **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** metric. The lower the RMSE value, the more accurate the model's predictions are.
